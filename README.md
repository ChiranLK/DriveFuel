# Vehicle Parts and Fuel Booking Platform  

## Project Description  
This platform is designed to simplify the process of purchasing vehicle parts online and booking fuel services for customers and service stations. Built using **Java** and **MySQL**, the application provides a user-friendly interface for users to seamlessly order vehicle parts and schedule fuel bookings, making it easier for service stations to manage and track orders.

### Developed by:  
**Im Chiran Samiru Seransinghe**, an undergraduate at **Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT)**. This project utilizes **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts to create a structured and efficient system for managing vehicle parts sales and fuel bookings.

### Problem Solved  
The platform aims to address the challenges faced by vehicle owners and service stations, including:  
- Difficulty in purchasing vehicle parts online  
- Lack of an integrated system for booking fuel services  
- Managing inventory and customer orders efficiently

By developing this solution, the platform provides a streamlined experience for both customers and service stations, saving time and enhancing service quality.  

## Key Features  
- **Online Vehicle Parts Ordering**: Users can search, browse, and purchase vehicle parts online with ease.
- **Fuel Booking Service**: Customers can book fuel deliveries or refills for their vehicles directly through the platform.
- **Order Management for Service Stations**: Service stations can manage and track vehicle parts orders and fuel booking requests.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration for both customers and service stations.

## Technologies Used  
- **Java**: For developing the core application logic and functionalities.
- **MySQL**: To manage and store data related to users, orders, parts, and fuel bookings.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: To structure the code efficiently, allowing for better maintainability and scalability.

## Setup and Installation  

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url.git
   ```

2. Install MySQL and set up the database.  
   Use the following schema to create the necessary tables in MySQL:
